# cub3d
***This project is a graphic design project, inspired by the famous game [Wolfenstein 3D](http://users.atw.hu/wolf3d/). We need to create a "realistic" 3D graphical representation of the inside of a maze from a first person perspective, using Ray-Casting principles.***

This project also enables us to improve skills in: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.

## Technical considerations

- Allowed functions: ```open```, ```close```, ```read```, ```write```, ```malloc```, ```free```, ```perror```, ```strerror```, ```exit```, all functions of the ```math``` library and the ```MinilibX```

- All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary

- Management of window must remain smooth

- Allow for the display of different wall textures

- Allow for setting the floor and ceilling colors to two different colors

- Program must take a scene description file as a first argument

## Examples

<!-- to do list:
- Check how it works on Linux
- Add instructions on how to make it work on Linux
- Add Makefil to compile on MacOS and also Linux
- Find out what's different on the MacOS and Linux github version
- set the color to -1 so if not set correctly it won't run (done) -->
