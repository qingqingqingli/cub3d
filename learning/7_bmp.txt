**********************WHAT IS BMP*********************************

BMP is device-independent

The BMP extension represents Bitmap Image file. BMP file contains 
raster graphics data which are independent of display devices. That 
means a BMP image file can be viewed without a graphics adapter. 
BMP images are generally uncompressed or compressed with a lossless 
compression method. The files can store two-dimensional digital 
images with both monochrome and color. 

BMP: it's a binary file so it won't be easily deciphered by a plain
text editor but at its core it's basically a large array of pixel data. 

- A bitmap image file loaded into memory becomes a DIB data structure

**********************BMP FORMAT*********************************

3 Mandatory structures

1. BITMAP FILE HEADER:
[A bitmap file has a header or two depending on how you class them]
- 14 bytes
- To store general information about the bitmap image file
- Not needed after the file is loaded in memory

14 bytes are split into 5 fields
- bfType 2 bytes: the characters 'BM'
- bfSize 4 bytes: the size of the file in bytes
- bfReserved1 2 bytes: Unused - must be 0
- bfReserved2 2 bytes: Unused - must be 0
- bfOffBits 4 bytes: Offset to start of pixel data

2. DIB HEADER
- Fixed-size (7 different versions exist)
- To store detailed information about the bitmap image and define the 
  pixel format
- Immediately follows the Bitmap file header

3. PIXEL ARRAY
- Variable size (it can be as large as we want)
- To define the actual values of the pixels
- The pixel format is defined by the DIB header or Extra bit masks. Each
  row in the Pixel array is padded to a multiple of 4 bytes in size

**********************QUESTIONS***********************************

- Not sure if it's okay to choose one value for dpi
input->bmp.dpi = 72

- Need to figure out how to create an image
If an image is not created, create one;
if an image has been created, modify it;

- Now if an image is created, the overwriting of the file does not work properly

- not sure if S_IRWXU is needed


**********************LEARNINGS***********************************

y should start from input->res_y - 1
		/*bmp starts writing from bottom, therefore, it needs to start from input->res_y*/

it will always be an active image
		/*it will always be active image*/
