**********************COMPLETED WORK*********************************

- flood fill: change the starting point from the first 0 to the player position
DONE

- flood fill: need to make a copy of the original array before flood fill.
  After validating the map, free the copy version of the array 
DONE

EXIT OPTIONS
- Exit with ESC
DONE

DEFINES
- Need to change all the defines to the entire variable name
DONE

[FLOOD FILL ALGORITHM]
- flood fill: 4 way flood fill does not detect certain edge cases. 
  It can be changed to a 8-way flood fill algorithm
CHANGED TO 8 WAY FLOOD FILL

[PLAYER ORIENTATION & WALL RENDERING]
- Make sure the player is facing the correct orientation
- Make sure the wall texture is the correct rendering
Problem: West and East are swapped
FIXED

MAKEFILE
- how to compile the header file when it has been modified
ANSWER: add header file next to where you compile the c file

%.o: %.c $(HEADERS)
	@echo "CUB3D: Compiling $<"
	@$(COMPILE) $(FLAGS) $(INLCUDES) -c $< -o $@

[EXIT with pressing on red cross button]
- Check on imacs

**********************ELEMENTS TO WORK ON*********************************

[BMP FILE CREATION]

[RESIZE SCREEN]
- Oversize --> resize it to the screen resolution

[ERROR MANAGEMENT]
- double check

[INPUT PARSING]
- double check

[INPUT VALIDATION]
- double check
***map validate gives seg fault

[MEMORY LEAK]
- check on imac

[CLEAN CODE]
- one of the last tasks

[NORMINETTE]

[EVAL LIST BEFORE EVALUATION]
- makefile relinking
- norminette
- works properly on imac
- check different maps
- resolution variation (0, negative, super big)
- memory leaks on imac

**********************QUESTION*********************************

[ERROR MANAGEMENT]
- double check
- Protection for mlx_get_data_addr. As in the Man page, it does
not say that it returns NULL when it fails to create

	input->img_2.addr = mlx_get_data_addr(input->img_2.img,
	&input->img_2.bits_per_pixel, &input->img_2.line_length,
	&input->img_2.endian);
	-- to protect
- Protect all the malloc in gnl & libft? So need to send struct to function
- ft_split

[MAP FILES]
- To ask Roy to share

[KEY MOVEMENT]
- left right to rotate
- ask in the group

[check valid map]
- check borders?
- change the method

[BMP FILE CREATION]
