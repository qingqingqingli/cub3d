- what are the correlation and difference between map and screen measurement?
ANSWER: Only the resolution metrics are needed


- plane_orientation (0, 0.66)
Does the initialisation change based on the player orientation? 
ANSWER: It does change. West player position (-1, 0) is associated 
with a plane position of (0, -0.66)

- map_width
With an irregular map, does the width reflect the row that the player is at?
ANSWER: We don't use map width but the resolution width. 

- camera(x) & pos_x & pos_y
I need to cast the ray from the player position. Why do I need to calculate the camera(x)?
ANSWER: It will give a fishbowl kind of view if you cast it from the player position. 
Need to understand better. 

- Vector & two individual variables
What are the essential difference between a vector and two individually declared variables?
The declaration is the same, just the calculation of it is different. 

- SSH
Need to look into how to create a SSH key. 
Save the private key private and only distribute the public key. 
Upload the public SSH key.

- for DDA, is map_x the same as position_x? position_x is an int not a float
ANSWER: It needs to be double

- Need to remember that position_x represent horizontal position and 
  position_y represent vertical position
  input->array[position_y][position_x]


***********************************QUESTIONS*********************************

- How to make the loop to allow the ray casting variables to be constantly calcuated?
ANSWER: Use mlx_loop & mlx_hook & mlx_hook_loop

- Need to understand how the different metrics are used

- What is the difference between pos_x and input->dda.map_x

- Need to change all the defines to the entire variable name

- flood fill: 4 way flood fill does not detect certain edge cases. 
  It can be changed to a 8-way flood fill algorithm

- when you rotate a vector, you multiply it with the rotation matrix. 
  When do you actually multiply this?

- camera_x_pos = (2 * x / (double)input->res_x) - 1;
  what is this x?

- is hit a local variable or should it be part of the struct?
  while (input->dda.hit == 0)

- currently perform dda gives seg fault. The loop is probably not correct

- why can't we cast rays from the player position but the camera position?
  ANSWER from Bman: if you take the 'euclidian' distance, whatever is right
  in front of you is always closer than what's a little to the side. that 
  causes a fisheye effect and what we'd like is to see straight lines like 
  we would see in real life.

- (NOAH) My lldb does not work properly. Ask Noah to check if I am running
  it correctly

- (NOAH) To consider whether to instal dual booting. If so, ask Noah for
  help to install it.

- The correct way to calculate delta_dis_x & delta_dis_y
  Somehow, this does not work as a calculation
	input->dda.delta_dis_x = (ray_dir_y == 0) ? 0 :	((ray_dir_x == 0) ? 1 : abs(1 / ray_dir_x));
	input->dda.delta_dis_y = (ray_dir_x == 0) ? 0 :	((ray_dir_y == 0) ? 1 : abs(1 / ray_dir_y));

hello again
