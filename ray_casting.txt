*****************VARIABLES NEEDED FOR RAY CASTING************************

- posX, posY (position vector)

- dirX, dirY (initial direction vector)

- planeX, planeY (initial camera plane vetor: perpendicular to direction plane
length can be changed)

- FOV (ratio between the len of direction and camera plane determines FOV)

- current_time (the time of current frame)

- old_time (the time of previous frame)

- FRS (frames per second counter)

the time difference between old and current time frame determines
how much should move when a certain key is pressed (to move a constant
speed no matter how long the calculation of the frame takes) and for FRS

******************************PROCESS***********************************

~ create a screen with chosen resolution (mlx)

	mlx_win = mlx_new_window(mlx, 250, 250, "Hello world!");

~ let the game loop starts (every loop draws a whole frame and reads input)

	while (!done())

~ ray casting loop to calculate for each vertical stripe. 

[step 1] Inititate relevant variables & conduct necessary calculation.
         At the end, we have the vector information on player position, 
		 camera vector and ray direction vector

	//position vector(posX, posY);
	//camera vector(planeX, planeY);
	//ray direction vector(rayDirX, rayDirY);
	//int map_width;
	//int map_height;
	//int screen_width;
	//int screen_height;
		//??? what are the correlation and difference between map and screen measurement

	//calculate the ray direction vestor
	//right side of screen get coordinate 1, the center of screen get coordinate 0,
	  and the left side of screen get coordinate -1 //???

	for (int x = 0; x < w; x++)
	{
		double cameraX = 2 * x / double(w) - 1; 
		//w stands for screen width. It needs to be casted to double to do the calculation
		double rayDirX = dirX + planeX * cameraX;
		double rayDirY = dirY + planeY * cameraY;
	} 

[step 2] Initiate variables relevant to DDA algorithm
	//current square the ray is in(mapX, mapY);
	The ray
